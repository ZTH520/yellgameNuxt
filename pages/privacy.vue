    <p>	Yellgame and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads in the Google Display Network based on someone's past visits to your website.</p>

    <p>Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet, based on the user activity on 	Yellgame.</p>

    <p>Users may disable the use of the DART cookie by visiting the network's privacy policies and content of the Google ads. As you browse 	yellgame.com and other websites, online ad networks we work with may place anonymous cookies on your computer, and use similar technologies, in order to understand your interests based on your (anonymous) online activities, and thus to tailor more relevant ads to you. If you do not wish to receive such tailored advertising, you can visit this page to opt out of most companies that engage in such advertising. (This will not prevent you from seeing ads; the ads simply will not be delivered through these targeting methods.)</p>
